User and Tweet Classification
-Data annotation 
-Feature extraction 
-Model building and training
-Competition. 
I worked with raw data to extract features and labelled datasets for the initial training of a classification model. The goal was to decrease the overall Mean Squared Error (MSE) scores achieved for the tasks of classifying whether a user is a bot or determining if a tweet is political or not.
